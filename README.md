NOTES

- the project has been initiated with React + TypeScript + Vite + some ESLint rules
- the additional NPM packages installed are: Taiwind CSS (for basic styling), Axios (for fetching data) and Vitest + React Testing Library (for testing)
- the project structure: the main code is in file `App.tsx` where the Axios call / the API data fetching takes place. Afterwards, in `components/List.tsx`, the data is parsed and the results list is displayed
- the install the packages please write in the terminal `npm install`
- to run the app please write in the terminal `npm run dev`. In the browser the address is `http://localhost:5173/`
- to run the app please write in the terminal `npm run test`
- if you have any notes/questions I am happy to discuss them
